## Spotify dependencies

[node-spotify](https://github.com/FrontierPsychiatrist/node-spotify) requires `libspotify`, for example on OS X you can install with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Note you'll also need Xcode and the command line tools installed before installing Homebrew.

```sh
xcode-select --install
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew install libspotify
```

You'll need to download your Binary key from your Spotify [application keys](https://devaccount.spotify.com/my-account/keys/), and transfer your `spotify_appkey.key` to your home directory.

```sh
mv ~/Downloads/spotify_appkey.key ~/
```



## TIDAL dependencies

The unofficial Node.js [TidalAPI](https://github.com/lucaslg26/TidalAPI) requires `ffmpeg` for playback, for example on OS X you can install with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Note you'll also need Xcode and the command line tools installed before installing Homebrew.

```sh
xcode-select --install
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew install ffmpeg
```


## Check spelling with Google's Custom Search Engine API

This approach for spelling correction doesn't always return results, however because Google's results are based on popular terms it works well for correcting the spelling of popular music.

Create your [Custom Search Engine](https://www.google.com/cse/) configured to [Search the entire web](https://support.google.com/customsearch/answer/2631040?hl=en) and get your [Search engine ID](https://support.google.com/customsearch/answer/2649143?hl=en). Keys for the API can be obtained from your [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).


## Usage

Currently there is only one parameter for your Hashmusictag. All other parameters are prompted from command-line and saved to the `.twitspot` configuration file in your home directory.

To listen for #ðŸŽµfoobar.

```sh
twitspot foobar
```


## Slack integration

Bundled with twitspot are a couple [Headless](https://headless.io/) framework scripts you can use as a Slack integration, refer to the [Slack integration](https://github.com/pschroen/twitspot/wiki/Slack-integration) wiki for steps to setup.
